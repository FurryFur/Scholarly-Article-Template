\subsection{Objective Function}
We use WGAN-GP as our objective function [reference]. The original WGAN-GP formula is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\underset{\tilde{x} \sim P_g}{\mathbb{E}}[D(\tilde{x})] - \underset{x \sim P_r}{\mathbb{E}}[D(x)] + \lambda \underset{\hat{x} \sim P_\hat{x}}{\mathbb{E}}[(\Vert \nabla_\hat{x} D(\hat{x}) \Vert_2 - 1)^2]
\end{equation}
Where $P_\hat{x}$ is defined as the distribution formed from sampling uniformly along straight lines between pairs of points sampled from the data distribution $P_r$ and the generator distribution $P_g$. Since we expand our discriminator to have two outputs (conditional and unconditional) as in StackGAN [reference], the above equation needs to be modified to incorporate these separate outputs. Our formula then becomes:
\begin{equation}
\begin{align*}
\underset{\tilde{x} \sim P_{g \mid c}}{\mathbb{E}}[D(\tilde{x}, c)] - \underset{x \sim P_{r \mid c}}{\mathbb{E}}[D(x, c)] + \lambda \underset{\hat{x} \sim P_{\hat{x} \mid c}}{\mathbb{E}}[(\Vert \nabla_\hat{x} D(\hat{x}, c) \Vert_2 - 1)^2] \\
+ \underset{\tilde{x} \sim P_g}{\mathbb{E}}[D(\tilde{x})] - \underset{x \sim P_r}{\mathbb{E}}[D(x)] + \lambda \underset{\hat{x} \sim P_\hat{x}}{\mathbb{E}}[(\Vert \nabla_\hat{x} D(\hat{x}) \Vert_2 - 1)^2]
\end{align*}
\end{equation}
Where $P_{\hat{x} \mid c}$ is defined as the distribution formed from sampling uniformly along straight lines between pairs of points sampled from the conditional data distribution $P_{r \mid c
