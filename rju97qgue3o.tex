\subsection{Objective Function}
We use WGAN-GP as our objective objective function [reference]. The original WGAN-GP formula is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\underset{\tilde{x} \sim P_g}{\mathbb{E}}[D(\tilde{x})] - \underset{x \sim P_r}{\mathbb{E}}[D(x)] + \lambda \underset{\hat{x} \sim P_\hat{x}}{\mathbb{E}}[(\Vert \nabla_\hat{x} D(\hat{x}) \Vert_2 - 1)^2]
\end{equation}
However, since we receive two outputs from our descriminator, the above equation needs to be modified as follows to incorporate
