\subsection{Objective Function}
We use WGAN-GP as our objective function [reference]. The original WGAN-GP formula is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\underset{\tilde{x} \sim P_g}{\mathbb{E}}[D(\tilde{x})] - \underset{x \sim P_r}{\mathbb{E}}[D(x)] + \lambda \underset{\hat{x} \sim P_\hat{x}}{\mathbb{E}}[(\Vert \nabla_\hat{x} D(\hat{x}) \Vert_2 - 1)^2]
\end{equation}
Where $P_x$ is defined as the distribution formed from sampling uniformly along straight lines between pairs of points sampled from the data distribution $P_r$ and the generator distribution $P_g$. Since we expand our discriminator to have two outputs (conditional and unconditionl) as in Stackreceive two outputs from our discriminator, the above equation needs to be modified as follows to incorporate the conditional and unconditional outputs:
\begin{equation}
\underset{\tilde{x} \sim P_g}{\mathbb{E}}[D(\tilde{x})] - \underset{x \sim P_r}{\mathbb{E}}[D(x)] + \lambda \underset{\hat{x} \sim P_\hat{x}}{\mathbb{E}}[(\Vert \nabla_\hat{x} D(\hat{x}) \Vert_2 - 1)^2]
\end{equation}
