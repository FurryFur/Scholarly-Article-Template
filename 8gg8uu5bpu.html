<h1 data-label="956325" class="ltx_title_section">Training Data</h1><div>Our training data comes from seven different sound effect libraries, purchased from&nbsp;A Sound Effect[Reference], which we unfortunately cannot make publicly available. We opted to use commercial sound effects over publicly available ones due to their easy access, consistent audio quality and generally high quality metadata. The seven sound effect libraries used were: Animal HyperRealism[Reference], Articulated Magic Elements[Reference], Eclectic Whooshes[Reference], Gamemaster Audio - Pro Sound Collection[Reference], Lethal Energies[Reference], Polarity[Reference] and Swordfighter[Reference]. All these libraries can be found over at A Sound Effect[Reference], with sample audio available. Owing to the fact that we can only produce just over one second of audio, we first     preprocess the training audio by splitting audio clips on silent intervals, then discarding any audio clips that are longer than our network can produce. Our final dataset consists of 6,883 sound effects. In order to augment this dataset, we apply a small pitch shift at training time. This is similar to what is done in games to make repeated sound effects sound more natural and disguise the fact that only one sound effect is being used during .&nbsp;</div>
