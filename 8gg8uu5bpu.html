<h1 data-label="956325" class="ltx_title_section">Training Data</h1><div>Our training data comes from seven different sound effect libraries, purchased from&nbsp;A Sound Effect[Reference], which we unfortunately cannot make publicly available. We opted to use commercial sound effects over publicly available ones to ensure consistent audio quality and metadata. The seven sound effect libraries used were: Animal HyperRealism[Reference], Articulated Magic Elements[Reference], Eclectic Whooshes[Reference], Gamemaster Audio - Pro Sound Collection[Reference], Lethal Energies[Reference], Polarity[Reference] and Swordfighter[Reference]. All these libraries can be found over at A Sound Effect[Reference], with sample audio clips aeach one.</div>
