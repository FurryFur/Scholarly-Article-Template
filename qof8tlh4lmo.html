<h1 data-label="148606" class="ltx_title_section">Model</h1><div>Our model builds heavily on the WaveGAN architecture by [Author names here][Reference here]. The original WaveGAN implementation ported the DCGAN [Reference to original DCGAN paper] architecture to 1D to work with audio data. We replace the existing 1D DCGAN model with our own 1D implementation of Progressive GAN [paper reference]. We also extend the model to support conditioning text, taking heavy inspiration from StackGAN's [paper reference] text conditioning implementation. StackGAN's model uses text embeddings which are downsampled to 128 dimensions, however, the embedding model used is not specified. We choose to use ELMo for&nbsp;</div>
