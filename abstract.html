<div>While voice, image and text synthesis are heavily studied areas in the field of machine learning, applications of generative models in the area of sound effect synthesis has received relatively little attention. This paper aims to be a proof of concept demonstrating the possibility of synthesizing game ready sound effects from an input text description using machine learning models. Using a Generative Adversarial Network model we are able to synthesis believable sound effects from text. We observe that the model is able to reproduce simple sounds, such as hitting and footsteps, with a good degree of believability. We also observe that synthesized sound effects match the supplied conditioMore complex sound effects such as human vocalizations can be generated by training the model on a targeted dataset of sound effects that contain only that category of sound effect.&nbsp;</div>
