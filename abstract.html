<div>While voice, image and text synthesis are heavily studied areas in the field of machine learning, applications of generative models in the area of sound effect synthesis has received relatively little attention. This paper aims to be a proof of concept demonstrating the possibility of synthesizing game ready sound effects from an input text description using machine learning models. Using a Generative Adversarial Network model we are able to synthesis believable sound effects from text. We find that, when training on small audio collections, covering a few limited categories of sound effects, the network is able to perform very well.&nbsp;</div>
