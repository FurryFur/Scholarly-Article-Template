<h2 data-label="281187" class="ltx_title_subsection">Retrieved Audio Diversity</h2><div>Low diversity within generated sound effects is currently our models biggest drawback, 92% of sound effect sets, generated using the given conditioning text, were rated as having no diversity at all(Fig&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{443553}</span>). We find this a somewhat surprising outcome, as the WGAN-GP object function we are using is purportedly free of mode collapse [reference]. The StackGAN model, which our conditioning implementation is heavily inspired by, also does not suffer from similar mode collapse[reference]. We find that, in our model, the generator learns to disregard the input noise vector, leaving the generated sound effects to be almost entirely determined by the conditioning input. A possible solution might be to use heavy&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
