<h2 data-label="281187" class="ltx_title_subsection">Retrieved Audio Diversity</h2><div>Low diversity within generated sound effects is currently our models biggest drawback, 92% of sound effect sets, generated using the given conditioning text, were rated as having no diversity at all(Fig&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{443553}</span>). We find this a somewhat surprising outcome, as the WGAN-GP object function we are using is purportedly free of mode collapse&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{gulrajani2017improved}</cite>. The StackGAN model, which our conditioning implementation is heavily inspired by, also does not suffer from similar mode collapse . We find that, in our model, the generator learns to disregard the input noise vector, leaving the generated sound effects to be almost entirely determined by the conditioning input. A possible solution might be to use heavy dropout to introduce noise directly into the conditioning vector. This seems like a rather heavy handed solution, and better ways of increasing diversity are left as an open area for future research.&nbsp;</div>
