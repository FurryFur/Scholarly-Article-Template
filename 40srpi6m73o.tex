Our generator $G$ takes a 128 dimension random noise vector $z \sim N(0, 1)$ and an ELMo text embedding $c$ of the conditioning text as input. $G(z, c)$ first calculates a reduced dimensional text embedding $\hat{c}$ by passing $c$ through a fully connected layer, reducing the embedding size from 1024 dimensions to 128. $\hat{c}$ and $z$ are then concatenated together and passed through another fully connected layer before being reshaped into a 16 x 512 dimensional vector for input into the first residual block.
