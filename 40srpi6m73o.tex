Our generator $G$ takes a 128 dimension random noise vector $z \sim N(0, 1)$ and an ELMo text embedding $c$ of the conditioning text as input. We first pass $c$ through a fully connected layer to reduce the embedding size from 1024 dimensions, down to 128 dimensions to match the dimensions of $z$. These two input vectors are then concatenated together and passed through another fully connected layer before being reshaped into a 4 x 512 dimensional
