Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{819959}</span> and&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{928895}</span> show real and generated waveforms for a falling debris sound effect. In the real waveform we see several clear and distinct audio events, which correspond to the hits of small individual pieces of rubble after an initial impact. However, in the generated audio things are a lot more muddied. In general, the generated audio waveform contains too much variation, resulting in a much higher level of baseline noise. Individual hit events are not clearly distinguishable from this noise and don't have clearly defined structure. In the real waveform, it is clear that each hit event is very structurally similar to previous hit events, however, in the generated waveform we see little semblance of any repeated patterns. Instead we observe random spikes in ampliWe also observe that there appears to be too much variation at higher LODs but too little at lower LODs.</div>
