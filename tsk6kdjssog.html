Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{819959}</span> and&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{928895}</span> show real and generated waveforms for a falling debris sound effect. In the real waveform we see several clear and distinct audio events, which correspond to the hits of small individual pieces of rubble after an initial impact. However, in the generated audio things are a lot more muddied. The ger</div>
