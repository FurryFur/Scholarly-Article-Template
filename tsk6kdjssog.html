Figures&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{819959}</span> and&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{928895}</span> show real and generated waveforms for a falling debris sound effect. Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{667351}</span> shows a side by side comparison of the corresponding spectrograms. In the real waveform we see several clear and distinct audio events, which correspond to the hits of small individual pieces of rubble after an initial impact. However, in the generated audio things are a lot more muddied. In general, the generated audio waveform contains too much variation in the higher LODs, resulting in a much higher level of baseline noise. Individual hit events are not clearly distinguishable from this noise and don't have clearly defined structure. In the real waveform, it is clear that each hit event is very structurally similar to previous hit events, however, in the generated waveform we see little semblance of any repeated patterns. Instead we observe what seem more like random spikes in amplitude. The resulting generated sound effect subjectively appears to get the initial impact correct, but fails to capture the long running patterns of repeated small debris hits and instead we get something that sounds more like random scratching and popping. It is clear from the spectrogram representation however, that our model is able to capture the correct&nbsp;</div>
