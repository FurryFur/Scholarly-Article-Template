<h2 data-label="754784" class="ltx_title_subsection">Condition Matching / Retrieval</h2><div>We find that our conditioning input is able to strongly associate generated sound effects to a particular category (Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{698992}</span>) allowing good retrieval results for user entered search queries. Judges only marked generated sound effects as not matching at all 24% of the time. We believe these failure cases are due to our model failing to converge on some modalities, and possible bleeding between different modalities due to the gradient penalty present in our training loss [Reference on catastrophic forgetting and mode collapse]. However, we were unable to get our model to converge using the original DCGAN training loss [reference dcgan paper]. A DCGAN training loss is usually shown to produce better results, in less time, than the WGAN-GP training loss, if training can be stabilized. Gett our model to work with a DCGAN training loss may be an interesting area for future improvement of the model.</div>
