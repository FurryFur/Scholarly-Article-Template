<h2 data-label="754784" class="ltx_title_subsection">Condition Matching / Retrieval</h2><div>We find that our conditioning input is able to strongly associate generated sound effects to a particular category (Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{698992}</span>) allowing good retrieval results for user entered search queries. Judges only marked generated sound effects as not matching at all 24% of the time. We believe these failure cases are due to our model failing to converge on some modalities, and possible bleeding between different modalities due to the gradient penalty present in our training loss<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{thanh2018catastrophic}</cite>. However, we were unable to get our model to converge using the original DCGAN training loss <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{radford2015unsupervised}</cite>. A DCGAN training loss is usually shown to produce better results, in less time, than the WGAN-GP training loss, if training can be stabilized<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{gulrajani2017improved}</cite>. Getting our model to work with a DCGAN training loss may be an interesting avenue for future improvement to the model.</div>
