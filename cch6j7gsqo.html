<div> Each up and down block can either be in one of three modes. Fully off, in which case we treat the layer as a skip connection, implemented by a simple nearest neighbor, or average downsample for up and down blocks respectively. Fully on, in which case the skip connection is ignored and the layer becomes a residual block. Or partially on, which occurs during LOD transitioning. In this case we linearly interpolate between the output of the skip connection, and residual block&nbsp;</div>
