<h1 data-label="687807" class="ltx_title_section">Future Research</h1><div>We observe a number of failure cases in our present model which would be interesting areas of future research. Our first observation is that our present model is unable to capture long range dependencies. These include long range frequency changes, such as retro power-up sounds, which typically increase in pitch as time increases [compare generated to real waveforms].&nbsp; [To check: keyboard typing - gaps between audio events].&nbsp;</div>
