<h1 data-label="687807" class="ltx_title_section">Future Research</h1><div>We observe a number of failure cases in our present model which would be interesting areas of future research. Our first observation is that our present model is unable to capture long range dependencies. These include long range frequency changes, such as retro power-up sounds, which typically increase in pitch as time increases [compare generated to real waveforms].&nbsp; [To check: keyboard typing - gaps between audio events]. Our model is also fails to generate layered sound effects. The presence of layered signals presents an interesting distinction between audio and image data. Image data typically contains less layered signals than audio data. Image data can contain layered signals where the image contains reflections and transparency. However, there are typically only two or three signal layers in these cases, whereas audio data typically contains many overlapping signals. Sound effects especially are typically built up by layering different sounds on top of one another to produce rich expressive&nbsp;</div>
