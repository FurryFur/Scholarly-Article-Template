<h1 data-label="687807" class="ltx_title_section">Future Research</h1><h2 data-label="865239" class="ltx_title_subsection">Failure Cases</h2><div>We observe a number of failure cases in our present model which would be interesting areas for future research. Our first observation is that our present model fails to capture certain time dependent structures very well. We These include long range frequency changes, such as those typically present in power-up sounds, where the pitch increases with time [compare generated to real waveforms], as well as periodic or pulsating signals [compare generated to real waveforms]. In future we would like to expand our current model, or a variant of it, to a recurrent architecture, which is able to capture long range time dependencies and also output audio signals of vary length.</div><div></div><div>&nbsp;[To check: keyboard typing - gaps between audio events]. </div><div></div><div>Our model also has trouble generating layered sound effects. The presence of layered signals in audio data presents an interesting distinction from the image data that GANs are typically trained to generate. Image data typically contains less layered signals than audio data. Although image data can contain layered signals where the image contains reflections and transparency, there are typically only two or three signal layers in these cases, whereas audio data typically contains many overlapping signals. Sound effects especially are typically built up by layering different sounds on top of one another to produce rich and expressive audio signals. We find that our generative model has a tendency to produce somewhat muddy audio signals, which do not contain clearly distinguishable audio layers. An interesting area of future research would be to try to create a network that can produce a varying number of outputs, with each output corresponding to a separate audio source signal. These audio signals would then be combined to produce the final output signal. In order to do this we would first need to perform blind signal separation on the training data in order to separate out individual source signals from the original mixed signals. Then we would train a network to produce the set of source signals, instead of the final mixed signal.</div><div></div><div></div>
